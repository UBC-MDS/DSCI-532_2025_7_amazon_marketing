# Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science Consultancy Firm

Target Audience: Amazon Prime’s Customer Engagement and Marketing Teams

Customer churn and low engagement can significantly impact Amazon Prime’s revenue and customer satisfaction. Understanding the factors that contribute to subscription renewals, engagement levels, and user behavior is crucial for improving retention strategies. If we can identify patterns in user activity, preferred content, and subscription trends, Amazon Prime can optimize its offerings and enhance customer experience.
To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization dashboard that allows Amazon Prime’s customer engagement team to explore key factors influencing user retention and engagement. Our dashboard will provide insights into subscription renewals, content preferences, usage patterns, and customer feedback. Users will be able to filter and compare different variables, such as engagement frequency, favorite genres, and payment history, to uncover trends that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.
