# Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science Consultancy Firm

Target Audience: Amazon Prime’s Customer Engagement and Marketing Teams

Customer churn and low engagement can significantly impact Amazon Prime’s revenue and customer satisfaction. Understanding the factors that contribute to subscription renewals, engagement levels, and user behavior is crucial for improving retention strategies. If we can identify patterns in user activity, preferred content, and subscription trends, Amazon Prime can optimize its offerings and enhance customer experience. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization dashboard that allows Amazon Prime’s customer engagement team to explore key factors influencing user retention and engagement. Our dashboard will provide insights into subscription renewals, content preferences, usage patterns, and customer feedback. Users will be able to filter and compare different variables, such as engagement frequency, favorite genres, and payment history, to uncover trends that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# Description of the data

# Research questions

Bob is a Senior Customer Engagement Manager at Amazon Prime, and he wants to understand how user demographics, engagement patterns, and content preferences affect subscription renewals so that he can develop targeted strategies to improve user retention. He wants to be able to explore customer data to compare renewal rates across different user filters and identify trends that influence renewal behaviors.

When Bob logs on to the Amazon Prime Customer Retention Dashboard, he will see insights of user data, including trends in renewal behavior, purchase history, and engagement levels. He can filter the data by key variables like subscription type (manual vs. auto-renewal) or demographics (age, gender). This allows him to explore insights such as whether higher engagement correlates with increased renewal rates or if certain product categories drive higher retention.

For example, Bob might notice that users who manually renew their subscriptions tend to have lower engagement compared to auto-renew users. By exploring the Purchase History section, he discovers that users who purchase electronics have higher renewal rates, whereas book and clothing buyers show more frequent non-renewals. In the Rating Over Time section, he identifies a decline in user satisfaction among those whose subscriptions are about to expire, which could signal dissatisfaction and a potential reason for not renewing the subscription.

Based on these insights, Bob can now develop actionable strategies. Now, Bob can propose to higher executives or marketing teams to offer incentives for users to switch to auto-renewal to increase retention. He could also suggest prioritizing electronics-related content in marketing campaigns since it shows a positive correlation with renewals. To address the decline in user satisfaction, Bob could recommend improving customer support or improving content to these customers.
